# Live

Support your automated chat experiences with human expertise. Always-on agents required? Not with LoyJoy. The Live Chat feature will only be presented
when your agents are available. 

## How to set up the Live Chat

1. Add the "Live Chat" process module to your existing chat flow. 
2. Select users that will be designated to serve as agents and respond to the user entries in the Live section. You can add additional user to your tenant in settings.
3. Define exit settings to make sure the chat continues automatically after a certain time in case the agent is not responding. We suggest selecting an experience or a sub-process to proceed with.

Once the user enters the "Live Chat" process module, the agents receives a message in their Live section and can reply. Agents can use animations and lead the user to a certain experience or sub-process if needed.

On one side- the customer´s view and on the other side- the agent´s view. [Watch our short Live chat demonstration video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFMvH-iQWho)
