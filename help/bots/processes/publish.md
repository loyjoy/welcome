# How to launch your chatbot

Before you go live with your chatbot, make sure you test it and of course, share it with your colleagues. To do so, you will find three options on how to securely test your chatbot and grant feedback.

1. View your chatbot on a unique landing page. This landing page is just for your chatbot and can be shared with your team. (To spice up the landing page of your chatbot, add a background image by clicking on the settings icon.)


2. You also can review the chatbot on your smartphone. Just scan the QR code and try it out!


3. Explore how your chatbot will look like on your website by typing in your URL. (Disclaimer: Display problems might occur.)


There are so many ways to publish and distribute your chatbot. One way is to place it on a website of your brand. To integrate the chatbot to your website (as a button or chat bubble), simply copy the provided code snippet into your website code. It's as simple as that!


But there are much more ways to publish your chatbot such as various social media channels.
To post your chatbot directly into an Instagram Story, simply copy and paste the appropriate link into the Swipe-Up link.

If you have questions regarding other channels (like Amazon Alexa, Facebook or WhatsApp), please contact your LoyJoy Success manager.


Do you want to run an A/B test with two (or more) different chats on the same website? [Check out how this works!](https://github.com/loyjoy/welcome/blob/master/documentation/DYNAMIC_LANDING_PAGE.md)
