# NLU

NLU stands for Natural Language Understanding. Your chat experiences have a free text field in which customer can type their requests and comments. With NLU, you can create so called "intents" concerning a certain topic (e.g. goodbye). Now you enter 10-20 example sentences ("Utterances") related to the topic of goodbye that you think could be a possible input from a customer (e.g. "see you later","goodbye", "bye"). By training the AI, our algorithm generalises your example sentences and is now able to identify most related text inputs on the topic. Then you define a specific response for your intent (e.g. "Have a good day!") to be displayed once a customer addresses this specific intent.   

**Utterances** - Please use a minimum of 10 possible entries and seperate them with line breaks.    

Example:   

Brand lover (Intent)     

Utterances:    
I love it   
I like your brand   
love brand     
admire your brand   
I like.  

Response:    
We understand. We love our brand as well! :-)
